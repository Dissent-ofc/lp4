# Lab Program 3: Forking, Push, Pull and Clone

**Scenario:**
Demonstrate the workflow of contributing to an open-source project by forking a repository, making a specific modification, and submitting those changes back to the original author.

**Task List:**

1.  **Fork the Project:**
    Log in to your GitHub account and create a **Fork** of the specified repository (e.g., the one provided by the examiner). [cite_start]This will create a copy of the remote repository under your own account[cite: 681, 715].

2.  **Clone Locally:**
    [cite_start]Clone your newly forked repository from your GitHub account into your local machine to establish a local working directory[cite: 693, 716].

3.  **Modify and Commit:**
    Identify the existing branch named **testing** (or *test*). Delete this branch from your local repository. [cite_start]After deleting it, perform a **commit** (by modifying a file if necessary) to record the changes in the history[cite: 683, 685, 717].

4.  **Push Changes:**
    [cite_start]Push the recent changes (the deletion and the new commit) from your local machine back to your **Local Fork** on GitHub[cite: 686, 718].

5.  **Create Pull Request:**
    [cite_start]Go to the GitHub webpage for your forked repository and create a **Pull Request** to send your changes back to the original author's repository for review[cite: 698, 719].
